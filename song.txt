Today is gonna be the day,
That they gonna make it stand for you
By now you shouldnt somehow
Realize what we gonna do

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you, but I don't know how

Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
